Innovative Idea:
	Our project idea is to implement a web application where people can search, add, and read product reviews. These reviews will be in the form of upvotes, downvotes, and comments on items in different categories. Some of the categories that we plan to integrate into the application are: beauty, entertainment, food, and travel. This application will be similar to some shopping websites in a way that the users have the ability to click on the item that they are interested in, and be directed to a different page where they can see more details about the particular item. These details will not only include the reviews such as the comments and votes for the item, but it will also have links to buy that item from different online stores. 
 	We plan to integrate some key concepts from social media in our app. On social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, users are able to give reactions and likes to each other’s posts and the person who’s posting can see the feedback they are receiving from other users. Since this is a familiar concept that many people do on a daily basis, the survey application will be very straightforward and intuitive to use.

Important Components:
	When a person posts a product in the form of an image, people can react to the post by adding a thumbs up or a thumbs down with a click of a button with each choice affecting the overall rating of that product. Each voting for any product will have a limited time period that’s available for user voting interaction. After the voting phase has closed, the users will not be able to react. There are multiple reviewed products on the website, and they will be filtered from most positive ratings to most negative ratings for each category. This allows the user to research and make better choices in their purchases. This is good for getting product recommendations, and also sharing product reviews based on personal experiences.
