## WeVote App

### Fall 2021

	We have implemented a web application where people can add and read product reviews in different categories. These reviews will be in the form of upvotes and downvotes on items in each category. Some of the categories that we have integrated into the application are: Entertainment, Food, and Travel. This application will be similar to some shopping websites in a way that the users have the ability to click on the item that they are interested in, and be directed to a different page where they can see more details about the particular item. These details will include the description of the item. 
 	We plan to integrate some key concepts from social media in our app. On social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, users are able to give reactions and likes to each other’s posts and the person who’s posting can see the feedback they are receiving from other users. Since this is a familiar concept that many people do on a daily basis, the survey application will be very straightforward and intuitive to use.

Team Members: A list of your team members, with names and GitHub aliases.
User Interface: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.
APIs: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s API
Database: A final up-to-date representation of your database including a brief description of each of the entities in your data model and their relationships if any.
URL Routes/Mappings: A final up-to-date table of all the URL routes that your application supports and a short description of what those routes are used for. You should also indicate any authentication and permissions on those routes.
Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.
Division of Labor: A breakdown of the division of labor for each team member — that is, saying who did what, for the entire project. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.
Conclusion: A conclusion describing your team’s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.

Our application is deployed on heroku on this link: https://wevoteapp.herokuapp.com
