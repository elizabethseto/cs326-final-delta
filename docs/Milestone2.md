Application Structure

1. User Object - ID, Name, Email, Password
2. Product Object - prod_ID, Name, Category, Description, Details, upVotes, downVotes
3. Page Object - page_ID, List (Product Objects)
4. upVote - Is a relationship between 1 Product & 1 User. Each vote is associated with the product name when a user interacts with it.
5. downVote - Is a relationship between 1 Product & 1 User. Each vote is associated with the product name when a user interacts with it.

For our API, we will need CRUD operations with endpoints for:
1. /addProduct which allows for a product to be added to the page when a request is sent to this endpoint containing the  Name, Description, Details, etc. of this product.
2. /productInfo is a read endpoint which returns all fields for the product as a JSON object
3. /createUser  which allows for a new user to sign up with their information
4. /upvote which adds an upvote to the given product  provided a product name, and also increments the upvote count. 
5. /downvote which adds a downvote to the given product  provided a product name, and also increments the downvote count. 
6. /deleteProduct  which allows the user to remove the product they have added to a category for rating
7. /viewPage which should let the user view a page they requested for

Our  file structure to implement:
1. server.js - a server that handles parsing the incoming requests with their URLs and parameters and sends that information to the correct functions. 
2. database.json - a file that stores the database
3. database.js - a file that implements database logic, has functions such as write(), find(), remove(), and update() and handles any errors that may occur
3. pageview.html - a file that renders HTML to view any page
4. productview.html - a file that renders HTML to view any product 
5. productview.js - a client-side JS file which pings the endpoint via fetch for Pageview/product/lookup/ and then uses the returned JSON to inject HTML (via innerHTML) into the productview.html file so that the product details can be viewed

For example, if the user clicked on the travel category, he could see places such as Paris, Mexico, and Tokyo. Within this page, the view button will direct the user to a more detailed page of the place he or she selected. The user would also be able to upvote and down a 
particular place.
